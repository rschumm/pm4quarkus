# helloquarkus - Blueprint Documentation 

This is a ¬´HelloWorld¬ª Blueprint Project based on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) used as a demonstration for PM4 at zhaw.   
We use it here just because the author likes Quarkus üòâ  

The App just shows a list of PM4 Project Proposals stored in a PostgreSQL Database. 

Quarkus is an Open Source Java Framework for Cloud Native Applications sponsored by RedHat, which is designed to be fast, small and easy to use. It is a set of opinionated open source libraries and tools that are designed to work together. One of the additional key features is the ability to compile Java applications to native executables using [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) - which is not used in this Project.  

## run DEV locally 

To start in hot-code mode use 

    quarkus dev 
    mvn quarkus:dev 

(`quarkus` is the Quarkus command line tool which can be installed via your preferred package manager.)

pressing 
- `d` in dev mode opens the DevUI with the Endpoints and all sorts of other stuff (like Tests, installed Extensions, OpenAPI GUI (aka Swagger), DB Connections, Config Parameters, Dependency Graph etc.)
- `w` will open the Application in the Browser.
- `r` will resume the continous integration tests. 
- `q` will quit the App.

To run properly, it need a working Docker or Podman environment on the Development machine. (If not, you have to provide a PostgreSQL Database manually)


## run PROD on cluster

## Architecture / Demonstration Canvas 

The Project covers and showes following layers: 


| Stack | DEV (local) | PROD (on cluster) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Build | Maven | Maven |
| Hot Reoload | Quarkus Dev-Mode | none |
| Database | Quarkus Dev-Services (PostgreSQL Testcontainers) | PostgreSQL |
| Test Data | `import.sql` (Hibernate) | flyway migration files |
| Database DDL generation | Hibernate through Panach√© | Hibernate through Panach√© |
| Persistence | Panach√© | Panach√© |
| Integration Tests | RestAssured | RestAssured |
| REST | Quarkus RESTEasy | Quarkus RESTEasy |


Details see: 


### PostgreSQL Database / Testcontainers

DEV:  

This project uses Quarkus Dev-Services for Databases in DEV mode.  
A PostgreSQL Database is started in a Docker Container automatically during DEV mode - using [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) in the background.   
This happends ¬´by convention¬ª, i.e. without any further configuration in the `application.properties` file. The System knows that it should start a PostgreSQL Database in a Container, because the Project uses the `quarkus-jdbc-postgresql` Extension.   
Testcontainers is running a `ryuk` container to manage the lifecycle of the containers, so that they are removed after the tests are run. This does not always work as expected, so you might have to remove the containers manually and clean up with `podman system prune -a --volumes` carefully. 

See:   
https://quarkus.io/guides/databases-dev-services

Note: the current Database Connection parameters (the one running in a Container) can be looked up in the DevUI.  


PROD:

Production DB can be configured ¬´normally¬ª as described above.  

### Panach√© Persistence 

For Persistence, it uses a very pragmatic variant of Hibernate, called [Panach√©](https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache).  

Note: the Attributes of the Entity use `public` Java Variables - this is intentional, a feature of Panach√© and not an anti-pattern!!  

### Integration Tests 

This Project Uses Restassured to run Integration Tests towards a fully running Quarkus REST Endpoint (using the above metionned Testcontainers PostgreSQL Database) and is not using any Mocks!   
The Tests are run continously in DEV mode in the console and can also be watched in the DevUI.   

Note: running `mvn test` will fail, as it also runs the Quarkus Integration Tests annotated with `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` , which are not configured to use the Testcontainers Database. This is a known issue of Quarkus.  


### Web Frontend

To add own static web content see [Quarkus HTTP](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference) and [Quarkus Web](https://quarkus.io/guides/web). The default welcome page will then disappear. 

The Application serves a very simple HTML Page with a list of PM4 Project Proposals based on the [Quarkus Qute Templating Engine](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute#qute-reference-guide). The Web Page is served by the Quarkus REST Endpoint just like the JSON Data. 




# üèóÔ∏è Quarkus Generated Documentation (for infroamtion)

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/helloquarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
